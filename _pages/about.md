Hello, welcome! My name is Yufeng Zou. I am a first-year Ph.D. student in the Computer Science Department at Northwestern University,
advised by Prof. [Han Liu](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/research-faculty/directory/profiles/liu-han.html){:target="_blank"}, 
and a member at the [MAGICS Lab](http://magics.cs.northwestern.edu/index.html){:target="_blank"}. 
My research interests center around developing large-scale machine learning models and algorithms to deliver insights from massive temporal data and assist decision making, especially in the business domain.
My primary focus is on high-dimensional time series analytics. I am also exploring network learning, recommender systems, text mining, and machine learning problems in general. 


Misc
======
I enjoy different kinds of sports activities, especially badminton, soccer, and cycling. I am also a fanatical fan of classical music. 
I have moderate proficiency in playing the violin, and I am learning to play the piano. I collected quite a few CDs and music scores for fun.
