Hello, welcome! My name is Yufeng Zou. I am a first-year Ph.D. student in the Computer Science Department at Northwestern University,
advised by Prof. [Han Liu](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/research-faculty/directory/profiles/liu-han.html), and a member at the [MAGICS Lab](http://magics.cs.northwestern.edu/index.html). 
My research interests center around developing machine learning models and algorithms to deliver insights from massive temporal data and help people make decisions, especially in the business domain.
I currrently focus on high-dimensional time series analytics. My other interests span network analytics, recommender systems, and text mining. 


Misc
======
I enjoy different kinds of sports activities, such as badminton, soccer, and cycling. I am a great fan of classical music. 
I am a proficient player of violin, and I am learning to play the piano on my own. I collected quite many CDs and violin music scores for fun.
